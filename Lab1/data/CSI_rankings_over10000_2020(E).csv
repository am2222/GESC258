1. Data presented in this table are at police service level and will differ from the data for census metropolitan areas of the same name.,,,,,,,,
"2. The crime statistics reported for the following police services contain a notable proportion of incidents that occur within the local correctional facility:  Northumberland (Brighton), Ont.; Napanee (Greater Napanee), Ont.; Fort Saskatchewan, Alta.

"3. Population over 10,000 refers to a police service that polices at least one census subdivision with a population of 10,000 or more.  Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities. A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations.
